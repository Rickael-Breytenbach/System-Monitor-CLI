______NOTE______
Make sure that once all files are added and sorted correctly, that you run "cd system-monitor" in the terminal, to change directory into the "systems-monitor" folder.
Once that is done, run "npm install", and then run "npm start" to start the program.

The program will update the stats every 2 seconds. If you want to stop the program, just press "Ctrl+c".
